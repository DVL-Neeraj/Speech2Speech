  "translated_text": "\nRotkäppchen is the name of a German fairy tale, which is based on the French fairy tale \"La Caperucita rouge\" by Charles Perrault. The story revolves around a young girl who wants to visit her grandmother, who lives in a house in the forest. The grandmother has given the girls a red cap, and the girl often wears it, hence the name \"Rotkäppchen\" (which means \"redcap\" in German).\n\nBefore leaving, the girl's mother warns her about the dangers in the forest, and she should not stray from the path. The girl, however, decides to pick up some flowers for her grandmother, despite the warnings, and walks towards a meadow. In the meadow, the wolf takes the grandmother, who is asleep in her bed, and replaces her with a red dress and a red cap. The grandmother then wakes up and tries to find her way back home, but she is unable to recognize the wolf, as it has changed its appearance.\n\nThe wolf takes advantage of this opportunity and feeds the grandmother, who then lies in her bed, dressed in her nightgown. The girl arrives at the house and is unable to recognize the wolf, who has taken on her grandmother's appearance. She asks her grandmother why she has so big eyes, but the wolf explains that it can see better than the girl. The wolf is then eaten by a hunter, who frees the girl and her grandmother. The hunter fills the wolf's stomach with stones, causing it to stop moving and eventually die.\n\nRotkäppchen is a classic fairy tale that teaches children not to trust strangers too much and to be cautious. The story, while having a darker tone, is ultimately a good message to convey."
