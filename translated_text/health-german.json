  "translated_text": " I believe that a healthy diet is very important if you eat healthy you will have more energy to do sports and you will concentrate better in school. A healthy diet should be varied and contain many fresh things. It is therefore good to eat fresh fruit and vegetables every day. Unfortunately, fresh things are not always available in England, but they are definitely cheaper than buying fast food every day. Drugs such as alcohol or cigarettes are not a good idea because they can make you dependent and sick."
