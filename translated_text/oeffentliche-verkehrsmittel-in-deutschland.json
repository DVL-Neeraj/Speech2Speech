  "translated_text": " Living in Germany without a car is quite feasible due to the excellent public transportation network. Many people in major cities forgo owning a car and instead use trams, U-trains, and buses to travel between locations. A S-bahn is a type of rapid transit system that operates on elevated tracks and connects different city districts or nearby towns. U-bahnen, on the other hand, are subway or underground rapid transit systems that run beneath the ground and connect city districts as well. Intercity Express (I.C.E.) trains are high-speed trains that can reach speeds of over 300 kilometers per hour and connect major cities. Tickets for trains can be purchased online or at the train station, with some exceptions where tickets can be bought directly from the bus driver. Overall, it is possible to reach almost any location in Germany using public transportation, making it a convenient and eco-friendly option. Additionally, taking the bus or train allows for a more enjoyable experience of Germany's beautiful landscapes."
