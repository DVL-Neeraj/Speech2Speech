  "translated_text": " Sonja has always been frugal, even as a child. She would save a portion of her pocket money and deposit it in a piggy bank. When the piggy bank was full, she would go to a toy store with her mother and choose something nice with the money. She would then take the rest of the money to the bank. As an adult, Sonja continues to save a portion of her income each month. She no longer uses her piggy bank, but instead keeps her savings in a small cash box on a shelf in her kitchen. On her birthday, she saves a portion of her savings for a special purchase. Last year, she bought a new tablet with her savings. The remaining money is deposited into a bank account, ensuring she always has funds available for emergencies. This year, Sonja is turning thirty and has decided to use her savings to make a significant purchase, rather than buying something in a store. She has decided to attend a music festival, although she is still unsure of the exact details. However, she has made it clear that the cost of the festival is not a concern in this year."
